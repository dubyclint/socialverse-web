Logs
Read repo the last error log.    https://github.com/dubyclint/socialverse-web  Repository ID: 1059123986

Repository Name: socialverse-web

Owner: dubyclint

Your GitHub ID: 118350883.  Read the files to know all use and function of the missing file . Provide the missing file

I'll help you identify the missing file and provide it. Let me start by reading the repository to understand the project structure and then check the error logs.

decideFilesystem

Now let me explore the repository structure to understand the project:

listFiles

Let me check the package.json to understand the project dependencies and structure:

readFile

Now let me check the runtime logs for the service to see what error occurred:

getRuntimeLogsTool

The runtime logs show the container is continuously restarting. Let me check the build logs to see the actual error:

getDeploymentsTool

Now let me check the build logs for the latest deployment:

getBuildLogsTool

Perfect! I found the issue. The build error clearly shows:

Missing File: /abis/EscrowDeal.json

The error message is:



[error] [nuxi] Nuxt Build Error: [vite:load-fallback] Could not load /app//abis/EscrowDeal.json (imported by composables/useEscrowContract.ts): ENOENT: no such file or directory
Let me check what's in the abis directory and the useEscrowContract.ts file to understand what this file should contain:

listFiles

readFile

Now let me check the AdminControl.json to understand the ABI structure:

readFile

Perfect! Now I understand the structure. Let me check the full useEscrowContract.ts to see what functions are being called:

readFile

Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create the missing EscrowDeal.json ABI file based on the functions being called in the useEscrowContract.ts file:
